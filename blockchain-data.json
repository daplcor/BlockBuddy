    "kadena": [
      {
        "question": "What makes Kadena different from other blockchains?",
        "answer": "Kadena combines the security of Bitcoin-style Proof of Work with the scalability of its unique Chainweb architecture, allowing it to process thousands of transactions per second while staying secure and decentralized. It also features Pact, a human-readable and formally verifiable smart contract language designed for safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Kadena achieve high transaction throughput?",
        "answer": "Kadena uses a unique parallel-chain architecture called Chainweb that allows multiple chains to operate simultaneously, sharing security through a braided consensus mechanism. Each additional chain increases throughput linearly, allowing Kadena to scale horizontally."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Pact and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Pact is Kadena's native smart contract language designed with safety as a priority. It's human-readable, Turing-incomplete by design, and includes features like module versioning and capability-based security. These design choices help prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I transfer KDA between chains?",
        "answer": "Cross-chain transfers on Kadena can be done using wallets. The process involves specifying the source chain, destination chain, and recipient address. Under the hood, this uses Pact's built-in cross-chain capabilities to securely move assets between Kadena's multiple chains."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Marmalade and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Marmalade is Kadena's NFT standard that allows for the creation and trading of non-fungible tokens. Unlike many NFT standards, Marmalade separates token creation from policy, giving creators more flexibility. It also supports features like royalties, fractionalization, and complex trading policies."

    "general": [
      {
        "question": "What is Web3?",
        "answer": "Web3 refers to the vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology. Unlike Web2 (centralized platforms like Facebook and Google), Web3 aims to give users ownership of their data and digital assets, enable trustless transactions without intermediaries, and create open, permissionless systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between a DEX and a CEX?",
        "answer": "A DEX (Decentralized Exchange) operates without a central authority, using smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer trading. Users maintain control of their funds. A CEX (Centralized Exchange) is operated by a company that holds users' funds and matches orders, similar to traditional financial exchanges."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a smart contract?",
        "answer": "A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain that automatically enforces agreements between parties when predefined conditions are met. They enable trustless transactions without intermediaries and form the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps)."
